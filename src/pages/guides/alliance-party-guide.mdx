After selecting the desired quest and difficulty, choose the “Accept Quest” option.

Next type in a password, then select the second option under Password Settings and then “Accept in Current Block”. This will lock the whole instance so no other parties can join without a password. Communicate the password to the other party leaders as well as when it is made.
